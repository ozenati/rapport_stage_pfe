Thanks to its high efficiency and numerical accuracy, LU with partial
pivoting is a cornerstone algorithm in modern science. Yet, its data
dependent nature, due to pivoting and swapping, is difficult to capture
for emerging task flow programming models and runtimes. In this paper we
design and evaluate a version of the LU algorithm with partial pivoting
that can be expressed as a static graph suitable for efficient dataflow
scheduling.
