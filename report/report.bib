		 compiler generates the necessary code and a runtime
		 library exploits the existing parallelism by building
		 at runtime a task dependency graph. The runtime takes
		 care of the task scheduling and data handling between
		 the different processors of this heterogeneous

		 has been implemented to reduce the overhead of data
		 transfers. The approach has been implemented and tested
